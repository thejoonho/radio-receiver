📻 As part of my second year hardware design course (ECE295) project, our team built a radio receiver consisting of a limiter, bandpass filter, quadrature mixer, low-pass filter, and amplifier. We researched, simulated, prototyped, designed, assembled, and validated the system, which was later successfully integrated into a flexible radio transceiver.

🌟 Our team was awarded the _[ISTEP Best Communication Award](https://github.com/thejoonho/radio-receiver/blob/main/award.pdf)_ for our exemplary performance and academic achievement in ECE295: Hardware Design and Communication.

  > The YouTube video is filmed from the front side of the flexible radio transceiver so our team's radio receiver is difficult to see. However, the following   image is what you would see from the back side (You'll see our sexy black radio receiver 😎):
