📻 As part of my ECE295 hardware design course project, my team and I built a radio receiver consisting of a limiter, bandpass filter, quadrature mixer, low-pass filter, and amplifier. We researched, simulated, prototyped, designed, assembled, and validated the system, which was later successfully integrated into a flexible radio transceiver.
